 	<h1>Financing</h1>
 	<p>Dubai is a wonderful and unique city, with vast diversity in population and housing options. With so many types of properties on the market, a local lending specialist is a necessity. You need someone who is intimately familiar with loan-to-value tolerances for each type of property, market and construction changes, and the types of documentation required from both buyers and sellers.</p>

	<p>Propertyssimo provides one-stop shopping in real estate. We want to make sure your transaction closes smoothly and on-time. To make sure this happens we work with the best in the business. You'll see the difference when your real estate agent and lender work as a team.</p>

 <div class='row' style='margin:20px;'>
 	<h1>Get Pre-Approved</h1>
 	<p>We recommend that before you begin house hunting, you begin the loan pre-approval process. This gives you the advantages that you'll know exactly what price range to look in and a seller will take your offer more seriously.</p>
