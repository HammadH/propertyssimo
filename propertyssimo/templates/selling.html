  <h1 class='text-center'> Preparing your Property for Sale</h1>
  <h2 class='text-center'>Getting ready to sell? Don't know where to start?</h2>
  <p style='margin:25px;'>A good place to begin is to consider who your likely buyer(s) will be. When you have some idea of your likely buyers, think what attributes that group of buyers is looking for in a property. Now look objectively at your property and note which of those qualities it has and which it does not. Also, consider what qualities your likely buyers would consider undesirable in a home (such as lack of parking or located on a busy street) and note whether your property has any of those negatives. The combination of positive and negative attributes will determine the eventual sale price of your property.</p>
  <p style='margin:25px;'>To the extent possible prepare your home by increasing the positives and decreasing the negatives.
In today's marketplace many properties are 'staged' before they are placed on the market. Staging is designed to maximize the property's appeal to buyers. Staging can be as simple as de-cluttering and re-arranging furniture, major cleaning or as complex as a complete make-over including new paint, carpets, landscaping and furnishing. As you prepare to market your property, visit open houses of similar properties to see how they show. These homes are your competition. To get top dollar your house should look better than the best of the competition..</p>

<h2 style='margin:25px;'>Whether you opt for a full staging or a minimal do-it-yourself preparation of your property, the following guidelines should be observed:</h2>

<div class='col-lg-5' style='margin:25px;'>
<li><p>Keep it clean. Spotless in fact. Windows washed, fixtures and appliances sparkling, carpets and floors cleaned, garage and storage areas tidy. Everything looks better when it's clean. Buyers don't pay top dollar for dirt.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep it neutral. Replace your personal taste with a neutral palette. Buyers will be able to visualize their own taste better if they don't have to see through yours. Use a few small items such as a vase of flowers, dish of fruit or pillows on the couch to add color or texture.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep it simple. Clutter makes a property look smaller and personal items distract buyers.</p></li>
</div>
<div class='col-lg-1'></div>

<div class='col-lg-5' style='margin:25px;'>
<li><p>Keep it fresh.  Air your property out before showings and use mild or unscented fresheners to keep it smelling fresh (strongly scented air fresheners may have the opposite effect so be careful here).</p></li>
<li><p>Keep it warm and inviting. Buyers should feel very comfortable when they are looking at your property; if they don't they are less likely to imagine themselves being comfortable there.</p></li>
